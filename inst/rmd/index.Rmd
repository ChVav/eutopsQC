This report is automatically generated with the eutopsQC pipeline during DNA methylation data quality control. The interactive pages provide the following information:

1. Overview of failed samples and probe count by beadchip.
2. Plots of control probes on the Illumina Methylation array.
3. Raw fluorescence intensities.
4. Methylation beta value distribution.
5. Signal to noise ratio (quality control metric, primarily applicable to biobanked samples).
6. Overview of estimated immune cell composition (ic), age, and smoking CpG methylation (primarily applicable to patient samples).
7. Dimensionality reduction and clustering.
